# AMV After Effects Edit

This was the final project of my second year in the IMS. The time limit was only 4 weeks that's why it's only a small project but I'm really proud of my result in just such a short time. It was the first time for me editing with After Effects and I had a fun time experimenting with a lot of different things. This was a "different" project then the ones I usually do, which have a lot of coding in them. I wanted to do this project to let my creativity flow free and also try out new technologies. I chose to do an edit of a particular scene in an anime I like, because some of my online friends did these in their free time and have accumulated a lot of followers with their edits over the years.

At this point I wanted to shoutout <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shadpai/"> Shadpai </a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stryfx/">Stryfx </a> for inspiring me to do this kind of project.
